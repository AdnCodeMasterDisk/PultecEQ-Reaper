# PultecEQ-Reaper
This version emulates the behavior of the equalization curves of a pultec, it does not simulate any special equipment, it uses similarities with the physical structure of a pultec type equalizer, but it is not a genuine simulation of a real equipment, it is mainly used for color equalization Due to its large modifications on the frequency curve of a sound, keep in mind that it is still in a state of development.

## ESFR
This version has a selection of static frequencies (the control still has details to improve since it must be used with great tact because I still can't make it work perfectly, but it allows you to choose the frequencies with some practice) otherwise it has with a very interesting behavior when coloring the sound

## RFRQ
This version has a dynamic frequency selector that allows you to explore the frequency spectrum in a broader way without being linked to the static frequencies of a normal Pultec. In addition, it has a lowcut and hitcut filter to make the range of possibilities much wider. it has two different interfaces, according to taste and need
